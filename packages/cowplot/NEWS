cowplot 0.9.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Rewritten cowplot::ggsave function that calls ggplot2::ggsave
- More robust handling of R graphics device weirdness/plots popping up in the wrong places

cowplot 0.9.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Make examples and vignettes fail gracefully when magick package is not installed

cowplot 0.9.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a theme for maps, `theme_map()`. Code provided by Spencer Fox, https://github.com/sjfox.
- Added `axis_canvas()` function and related functions to make
  marginal plots and plot annotations simpler
- Now export the `plot_to_gtable` function which converts most
  anything into a gtable for further use with cowplot
- Added `inherit.aes = FALSE` to draw functions where needed
- Added examples to various draw functions
- Added draw_image() function to draw images onto plots

cowplot 0.8.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- The function plot_grid can now also handle base-R (graphics) plots. Code provided by https://github.com/flying-sheep.
- More sophisticated plot alignments of complex plots are now possible. Code provided by Spencer Fox, https://github.com/sjfox.
- Plot labels can now be styled. In particular, they follow the theme settings, e.g. if the theme uses a different font than default. This closes issue #37.
- The positioning of plot labels in `plot_grid` can now be controlled with additional position parameters `label_x` and `label_y`. This closes issue #32.
- Problems with elements from globally set themes leaking into the plot-grid background have been fixed. This closes issues #60, #63, #66.


cowplot 0.7.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
- This version of cowplot has been prepared for the upcoming release of ggplot2 2.2.0. As a result of this upcoming switch, the function switch_axis_position() has been removed. Alternative axes will be natively supported by ggplot2 2.2.0.
- As of this version, cowplot requires R >= 3.3.0. This dependency was added because R 3.3 fixes a critical problem with lists of units.

cowplot 0.6.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Adds a get_legend() function that extracts the legend from a plot. Code provided by https://github.com/marcus1487
- Fixes bug that creates an empty page on some plot devices. Fix provided by https://github.com/marcus1487
- Fixes bug that hardcoded panel border line-type and size. Fix provided by Spencer Fox, https://github.com/sjfox
- Adds the option of custom axes on the drawing layer. Code provided by https://github.com/zaczap
- Separates out the alignment function from plot_grid(). Will likely be more useful further down the line. Code provided by Spencer Fox, https://github.com/sjfox

cowplot 0.6.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Updated plot_grid vignette so the tutorial on aligning plots of different types works again. This stopped working at some point and was removed from 0.6.1.

cowplot 0.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Added new convenience function draw_figure_label() to label figures with labels such as "Figure 1".
- Fixes in switch_axis_position() so that rotated axis labels work.
- Fix missing axis lines in ggplot2 2.1

cowplot 0.6.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Major changes:
- Now requires ggplot2 version 2.0.0 or higher. Use cowplot 0.5.0 with older versions of ggplot2.
- Because of the dependency on ggplot2 2.0.0, the default design is changed. No more bold face for axis labels
- Add auto-generation of labels in plot_grid()
- Add vignettes describing plot annotations and shared legends among plots

cowplot 0.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Major changes:
- Fix label positioning in plot_grid() so it is not affected by the scale parameter
- Add draw_label() function which can draw both text and plotmath expressions
- Add parameters hjust and vjust to plot_grid() to allow fine-tuning of label position
- Add annotations underneath plot, via add_sub() function

Other changes:
- Improve vignettes

cowplot 0.4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Major changes:
- Added a function switch_axis_position() which can move/copy the x and/or y axis of a
  plot to the other side
- plot_grid() can now align graphs
- plot_grid() can now make grids with varying column widths and row heights

Other changes:
- Various improvements in the documentation
- Code has been separated into multiple files for easier maintenance

cowplot 0.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
Fix Vignette title

cowplot 0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
First complete implementation ready for initial release
