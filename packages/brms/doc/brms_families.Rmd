The purpose of this vignette is to discuss the parameterizations of the families (i.e., response distributions) used in **brms**. For a more general overview of the package see `vignette("brms_overview")`.

## Notation

Throughout this vignette, we use $y$ to refer to the response variable and $\eta$ to refer to the (non-)linear predictor (see `help(brmsformula)` for details on supported predictor terms). We write $y_i$ and $\eta_i$ for the response and linear predictor of observation $i$. Furthermore, we use $f$ for a density function, $g$ for an inverse link function, and
denote $\mu = g(\eta)$.

## Location shift models

The density of the **gaussian** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y_i - \mu_i}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
$$ 
where $\sigma$ is the residual standard deviation. The density of the **student** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\Gamma((\nu + 1)/2)}{\Gamma(\nu/2)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\nu\pi}\sigma}
\left(1 + \frac{1}{\nu} \left(\frac{y_i - \mu_i}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)^{-(\nu+1)/2}
$$
$\Gamma$ denotes the gamma function and $\nu > 1$ are the degrees of freedom. As $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, the student distribution becomes the gaussian distribution. The density of the *skew_normal* family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y_i - \xi_i}{\omega}\right)^2\right) \left(1 + \text{erf} \left( \alpha \left(\frac{y_i - \xi_i}{\omega \sqrt{2}} \right) \right) \right)
$$
where $\xi$ is the location parameter, $\omega$ is the positive scale parameter, $\alpha$ the skewness parameter, and $\text{erf}$ denotes the error function of the gaussian distribution. To parameterize the skew-normal distribution in terms of the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, $\omega$ and $\xi$ are computed as
$$
\omega = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2}{\pi} \frac{\alpha^2}{1 + \alpha^2}}}
$$
$$
\xi_i = \mu_i - \omega \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1 + \alpha^2}} \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}
$$
If $\alpha = 0$, the skew-normal distribution becomes the gaussian distribution. For location shift models, $y_i$ can be any real value. 

## Binary and count data models

The density of the **binomial** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = {N_i \choose y_i} \mu_i^{y_i} (1-\mu_i)^{N_i - y_i}
$$
where $N_i$ is the number of trials and $y_i \in \{0, ... , N_i\}$. When all $N_i$ are $1$ (i.e., $y_i \in \{0,1\}$), the bernoulli distribution for binary data arises. **binomial** and **bernoulli** families are distinguished in **brms** as the bernoulli distribution has its own implementation in **Stan** that is computationlly more efficient. 

For $y_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$, the density of the **poisson** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\mu_i^{y_i}}{y_i!} exp(-\mu_i)
$$
The density of the **negative binomial** family is
$$
f(y_i) = {y_i + \phi - 1 \choose y_i} \left(\frac{\mu_i}{\mu_i + \phi}\right)^{y_i}
\left(\frac{\phi}{\mu_i + \phi}\right)^\phi
$$
where $\phi$ is a positive precision parameter. For $\phi \rightarrow \infty$, the negative binomial distribution becomes the poisson distribution. The density of the **geometric** family arises if $\phi$ is set to $1$.

## Survival models

With survival models we mean all models that are defined on the positive reals only, that is $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^+$. The density of the **lognormal** family is given by 
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma x} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\log(y_i) - \mu_i}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
$$ 
where $\sigma$ is the residual standard deviation on the log-scale.
The density of the **Gamma** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{(\alpha / \mu_i)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} y_i^{\alpha-1} 
\exp\left(-\frac{\alpha y_i}{\mu_i}\right)
$$
where $\alpha$ is a positive shape parameter. The density of the **weibull** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\alpha}{s_i} \left(\frac{y_i}{s_i}\right)^{\alpha-1} 
\exp\left(-\left(\frac{y_i}{s_i}\right)^\alpha\right)
$$
where $\alpha$ is again a positive shape parameter and $s_i = \mu_i / \Gamma(1 + 1 / \alpha)$ is the scale parameter to that $\mu_i$ is the mean of the distribution. The **exponential** family arises if $\alpha$ is set to $1$ for either the gamma or Weibull distribution. The density of the **inverse.gaussian** family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{2 \pi y_i^3}\right)^{1/2} \exp \left(\frac{-\alpha (y_i - \mu_i)^2}{2 \mu_i^2 y_i} \right)
$$
where $\alpha$ is a positive shape parameter.

## Extreme value models

Modeling extremes requires special distributions. One may use the **weibull** distribution (see above) or the **frechet** distribution with density
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\nu}{s_i} \left(\frac{y_i}{s_i}\right)^{-1-\nu} \exp\left(-\left(\frac{y_i}{s_i}\right)^{-\nu}\right)
$$
where $s_i = \mu_i / \Gamma(1 - 1 / \nu)$ is a positive scale parameter and $\nu > 1$ is a shape parameter so that $\mu_i$ predicts the mean of the Frechet distribution. A generalization of both distributions is the generalized extreme value distribution (family **gen_extreme_value**) with density
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{1}{\sigma} t(y_i)^{-1 - 1 / \xi} \exp(-t(y_i))
$$
where 
$$
t(y_i) = \left(1 + \xi \left(\frac{y_i - \mu_i}{\sigma} \right)\right)^{-1 / \xi}
$$
with positive scale parameter $\sigma$ and shape parameter $\xi$.

## Response time models

One family that is especially suited to model reaction times is the **exgaussian** ('exponentially modified Gaussian') family. Its density is given by

$$
f(y_i) = \frac{1}{2 \beta} \exp\left(\frac{1}{2 \beta} \left(2\xi + \sigma^2 / \beta - 2 y_i \right) \right) \text{erfc}\left(\frac{\xi + \sigma^2 / \beta - y_i}{\sqrt{2} \sigma} \right)
$$
where $\beta$ is the scale (inverse rate) of the exponential component, $\xi$ is the mean of the Gaussian componenent, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian component, and $\text{erfc}$ is the complementary error function.
We parameterize $\mu_i = \xi + \beta$ so that the main predictor term equals the mean of the distribution. 

Another family well suited for modelling response times is the **shifted_lognormal** distribution. It's density equals that of the **lognormal** distribution except that the whole distribution is shifted to the right by a positive parameter called *ndt* (for consistency with the **wiener** diffusion model explained below).

A family concerned with the combined modelling of reaction times and corresponding binary responses is the **wiener** diffusion model. It has four model parameters each with a natural interpreation. The parameter $\alpha > 0$ describes the separation between two boundaries of the diffusion process, $\tau > 0$ describes the non-decision time (e.g., due to image or motor processing), $\beta \in [0, 1]$ describes the initial bias in favor of the upper alternative, and $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$ describes the drift rate to the boundaries (a positive value indicates a drift towards to upper boundary).
The density for the reaction time at the upper boundary is given by

$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\alpha}{(y_i-\tau)^3/2}
\exp \! \left(- \delta \alpha \beta - \frac{\delta^2(y_i-\tau)}{2}\right)
\sum_{k = - \infty}^{\infty} (2k + \beta)
\phi \! \left(\frac{2k + \alpha \beta}{\sqrt{y_i - \tau}}\right)
$$

where $\phi(x)$ denotes the standard normal density function. The density at the lower boundary can be obtained by substituting $1 - \beta$ for $\beta$ and $-\delta$ for $\delta$ in the above equation. In **brms** the parameters $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $\beta$ are modeled as auxiliary parameters named *bs* ('boundary separation'), *ndt* ('non-decision time'), and *bias* respectively, whereas the drift rate $\delta$ is modeled via the ordinary model formula that is as $\delta = \mu_i$. 

## Quantile regression

Quantile regression is implemented via family **asym_laplace** (asymmetric Laplace distribution) with density

$$
f(y_i) = \frac{p (1 - p)}{\sigma} \exp\left(-\rho_p\left(\frac{y_i - \mu_i}{\sigma}\right)\right)
$$
where $\rho_p$ is given by $\rho_p(x) = x (p - I_{x < 0})$ and $I_A$ is the indicator function of set $A$. The parameter $\sigma$ is a positive scale parameter and $p$ is the *quantile* parameter taking on values in $(0, 1)$.
For this distribution, we have $P(Y < g(\eta)) = p$. Thus, quantile regression can be performed by fixing $p$ to the quantile to interest.

## Beta models

The density of the **Beta** family for $y_i \in (0,1)$ is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{y_i^{\mu_i \phi - 1} (1-y_i)^{(1-\mu_i) \phi-1}}{B(\mu_i \phi, (1-\mu_i) \phi)}
$$
where $B$ is the beta function and $\phi$ is a positive precision parameter.

## Circular models

The density of the **von_mises** family for $y_i \in (-\pi,\pi)$ is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\exp(\kappa \cos(y_i - \mu_i))}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)}
$$
where $I_0$ is the modified Bessel function of order 0 and $\kappa$ is
a positive precision parameter.

## Ordinal and categorical models

For ordinal and categorical models, $y_i$ is one of the categories $1, ..., K$. The intercepts of ordinal models are called thresholds and are denoted as $\tau_k$, with $k \in \{1, ..., K-1\}$, whereas $\eta$ does not contain a fixed effects intercept. Note that the applied link functions $h$ are technically distribution functions $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0,1]$.
The density of the **cumulative** family (implementing the most basic ordinal model) is given by
$$
f(y_i) = g(\tau_{y_i + 1} - \eta_i) - g(\tau_{y_i} - \eta_i)
$$ 
The densities of the **sratio** (stopping ratio) and **cratio** (continuation ratio) families are given by
$$
f(y_i) =  g(\tau_{y_i + 1} - \eta_i) \prod_{k = 1}^{y_i} (1 - g(\tau_{k} - \eta_i))
$$
and 
$$
f(y_i) = (1 - g(\eta_i - \tau_{y_i + 1})) \prod_{k = 1}^{y_i} g(\eta_i - \tau_{k})
$$
respectively. Note that both families are equivalent for symmetric link functions such as logit or probit. The density of the **acat** (adjacent category) family is given by
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{y_i} g(\eta_i - \tau_{k})
  \prod_{k=y_i+1}^K(1-g(\eta_i - \tau_{k}))}{\sum_{k=0}^K\prod_{j=1}^k g(\eta_i-\tau_{j})
  \prod_{j=k+1}^K(1-g(\eta_i - \tau_{j}))}
$$
For the logit link, this can be simplified to
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\exp \left(\sum_{k=1}^{y_i} (\eta_i - \tau_{k}) \right)}
  {\sum_{k=0}^K \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^k (\eta_i - \tau_{j}) \right)}
$$
The linear predictor $\eta$ can be generalized to also depend on the category $k$ for a subset of predictors. This leads to so called category specific effects (for details on how to specify them see `help(brm)`). Note that **cumulative** and **sratio** models use $\tau - \eta$, whereas **cratio** and **acat** use $\eta - \tau$. This is done to ensure that larger values of $\eta$ increase the probability of *higher* reponse categories.

The **categorical** family is currently only implemented with the logit link function and has density
$$
f(y_i) = \frac{\exp(\eta_{iy_i})}{\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \exp(\eta_{ik})}
$$
Note that $\eta$ does also depend on the category $k$. For reasons of identifiability, $\eta_{i1}$ is set to $0$.

## Zero-inflated and hurdle models

**Zero-inflated** and **hurdle** families extend existing families by adding special processes for responses that are zero. The densitiy of a **zero-inflated** family is given by
$$
f_z(y_i) = z + (1 - z) f(0) \quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\
f_z(y_i) = (1 - z) f(y_i) \quad \text{if } y_i > 0
$$
where $z$ denotes the zero-inflation probability. Currently implemented families are **zero_inflated_poisson**, **zero_inflated_binomial**, **zero_inflated_negbinomial**, and **zero_inflated_beta**.
The density of a **hurdle** family is given by 
$$
f_z(y_i) = z \quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\
f_z(y_i) = (1 - z) f(y_i) / (1 - f(0)) \quad \text{if } y_i > 0
$$
Currently implemented families are **hurdle_poisson**, **hurdle_negbinomial**, **hurdle_gamma**, and **hurdle_lognormal**.
The density of a **zero-one-inflated** family is given by
$$
f_{\alpha, \gamma}(y_i) = \alpha (1 - \gamma) \quad \text{if } y_i = 0 \\
f_{\alpha, \gamma}(y_i) = \alpha \gamma \quad \text{if } y_i = 1 \\
f_{\alpha, \gamma}(y_i) = (1 - \alpha) f(y_i) \quad \text{if } y_i \notin \{0, 1\}
$$
where $\alpha$ is the zero-one-inflation probability (i.e. the probability that zero or one occurs) and $\gamma$ is the conditional one-inflation probability (i.e. the probability that one occurs rather than zero). Currently implemented families are **zero_one_inflated_beta**.
