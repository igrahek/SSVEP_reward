Hey Ivan,
I have extracted the single-trial ssVEPs, you can find them in our GitHub repository (/figures/singleTrial_amplitudes.csv). Contrary to our previous data, the variable 'condition' has triggers instead of labels. You can easily fix this by adding in your script something like:

data <- data %>% 
	mutate(condition = recode(factor(condition),
						"1" = "baseline, red", "2" = "baseline, blue",
						"3" = "rewarded, red", "4" = "rewarded, red",
						"5" = "non-rewarded, red", "6" = "non-rewarded, red"
			)

This coding would be consistent with the figures I have just re-done (see /figures/topos_spectra.jpg and /figures/

I have yet to create plots displaying chains, posterior predictive checks, and posterior distributions of the winning models. When you have fitted them, please save the results in /figures like this:

saveRDS(model, file = "model.rds", compress =  "gzip")

Please give them self-explanatory names, so that I can extract the posterior distributions of the constant effects and finish the figures.
